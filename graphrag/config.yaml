    A question is relevant if:
    - The summary contains specific information that answers the question
    - The summary describes a context/domain where the question would be appropriate 
    - The summary indicates the agent/system can help with topics related to the question

    Question: {query}
    Summary: {context}

    Respond only with `true` if the question is relevant to the context, `false` if completely unrelated.
    Do not provide explanations.
